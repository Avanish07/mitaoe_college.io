            <h2>Our Certificates & online Programs For 2021</h2>
            <p>Every year, a new trend in India's education system arises. There was a period not long ago when medical and engineering courses were the most popular among students. Those days, however, are long gone, and a transition has occurred in which an increasing number of students are eager to explore sectors that highlight their skills, talents, and interests. Despite this, engineering as a course has not lost its lustre over the years, and a huge number of students continue to enrol as a result of emerging technologies. Many universities and colleges are increasingly using new and improved teaching methods, such as modern learning labs and technology-enhanced curricula. In order to keep up with worldwide standards, many universities have likewise updated their programmes. The MIT Academy of engineering has been rated as one of the top engineering colleges in pune due to its flexible curriculum and diversity in the style of learning.</p>
           <br>
            <p>The 4 Emerging Trends
                A number of technical institutes such as MITAOE have been built across the country in response to the growing number of students interested in engineering. There are other obstacles or issues that fail to provide the appropriate platform for students in the workforce. India, on the other hand, is doing everything it can to reinvent the technical education system in terms of quality and opportunities. For engineering seats at top institutions or colleges, millions of students take competitive exams like JEE, JEE Main, AIEEE, CET, and others. To cope up with the updated technology and meet the market standards MIT, Pune has inculcated a mix of both core courses and interdisciplinary courses in their syllabus. One needs to have all the skills required to face the challenges of the outside world.</p>
           <br>
           
           <p>Experiential learning
            There is currently a combination of hands-on instruction and traditional lecture learning. Hands-on learning programmes enable students to apply classroom materials in real-world settings such as 3D printing labs and cutting-edge research labs, enhancing their skills and ideas. Students learn more quickly, comprehend information better, and can handle key problems in a real-world setting.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Industry-specific Programs
                Many universities and institutes, such as Industry Partner Summit, have included industry-specific engineering curriculum into their classes. In such programmes, industry executives and lecturers address innovation, cutting-edge technologies and discoveries, tools, and trends in the engineering sector. The courses are then updated on a regular basis to ensure that students have access to the most up-to-date engineering information.</p>
